    <h2>The Beverly Hillbillies</h2>
    <p>
      Come and listen to my story about a man named Jed<br>
      A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed,<br>
      And then one day he was shootin at some food,<br>
      And up through the ground come a bubblin crude.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well the first thing you know ol Jed's a millionaire,<br>
      The kinfolk said "Jed move away from there"<br>
      Said "Californy is the place you ought to be"<br>
      So they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hills, that is. Swimmin pools, movie stars.
