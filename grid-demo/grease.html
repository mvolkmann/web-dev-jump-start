    <h2>Grease</h2>
    <p>
      I solve my problems and I see the light<br>
      We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right<br>
      There ain't no danger we can go too far<br>
      We start believing now that we can be what we are<br>
      Grease is the word
    </p>

    <p>
      They think our love is just a growing pain<br>
      Why don't they understand, it's just a crying shame<br>
      Their lips are lying only real is real<br>
      We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel<br>
      Grease is the word
    </p>

    <p>
      It's got groove it's got meaning<br>
      Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion<br>
      Grease is the way we are feeling<br>
      We take the pressure and we throw away<br>
      Conventionality belongs to yesterday<br>
      There is a chance that we can make it so far<br>
      We start believing now but we can be who we are<br>
      Grease is the word
    </p>

    <p>
      It's got groove it's got meaning<br>
      Grease is the time, is the â€¦
